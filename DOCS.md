As part of your submission, update this file with answers:

#### 1. Which API did you choose?
Genshin API  
API Webite: https://github.com/genshindev/api

#### 2. What inputs do you supply in your API request?
My API allows for the user to search for a Genshin Character based off of their vision/element type, name, or weapon type.

#### 3. What did you do for the "Beyond Baseline" requirement?
I created a main menu that allows the user to choose different regions of the game to show only the characters from that region.
I also included secondary filters that allow the user to search the API based off of the different filters avalible.


#### 4. What gave you difficulty with this assignment?
Getting the secondary searches since the API works only with inputing the character name in the URL, so in order to get the API to filter by character's visons/elements and weapon. I had to preloop the entire array of characters names beforehand and place their info in arrays I created so I can return those characters name if they had what the user serached for.


#### 5. What are you proud of with this assignment?
I like how the assignment turned out with the CSS and with how the API works :D
