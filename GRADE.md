I will update this file as part of the PR when I grade your work.

## API Request

*Earned:* **2** */ 2*

**Notes** : Does the job! (Even has secondary requests!)

## API Response

*Earned:* **2** */ 2*

**Notes** : Does the job!

* There is some error handling.
* I was able to find some cases ( Fontaine > Vision Type > Fire) where it displays an empty result - without any sort of message or other indicator that something went wrong.

## Sensible CSS

*Earned:* **2** */ 2*

**Notes** : Looks great!

* At narrow screen sizes, the "Search for a Character's name..." prompt is covered by the "Back" button.

## Reset

*Earned:* **2** */ 2*

**Notes** : Does the job!

* After using a filter, I'd expect the reset button to clear the filtered result and show all the characters again. (As it is now, I need to click "Back" and then click into a Location again to see the full list of characters.)

## Beyond Baseline

*Earned:* **2** */ 2*

**Notes** : It's clear you had some fun with this. I appreciate the extra effort going off-menu on the API, and having multiple request types. There are some minor things to tweak, but I didn't dock you points because of the extra effort you've taken elsewhere.

## Demerits

*Earned:* **-1**

**Notes** : Empty DOCS.md file.

# Total: 9 / 10

Excellent work. Fill in your DOCS.md and resubmit to get that point back!
